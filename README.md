The programs are in the following order

Fig. 3a. Empirical PDF of the Z score for filtered and unfiltered data

Fig. 3b. Empirical PDF of the t score for filtered and unfiltered data

Fig. 5. Variance of SPC due to filter impulse response for various TRs  
( Please extract the Filter.zip and place them in the folder in the location of the Fig5.R )

Fig. 6. Histograms of variance of the SPC before and after filtering 
( Please extract the NKI_DOF_BF.zip  and NKI_DOF_AF.zip and place the extracted folders ( NKI_DOF_BF and NKI_DOF_AF) in the  location same as  Fig6.R  or change the path accordingly in Fig6.R)
